<h4>Low and Slow</h4>
Posted by BGB, Novemer 15, 2012 
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sousvide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Greeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperaturepoaching</q>.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at Chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

Location: Bakers Corner, Seeking, MA
Hours: Tuesday To Saturday, 11am to Midnight
